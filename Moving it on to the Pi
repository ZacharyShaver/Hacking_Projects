The goal is to basically write a program at the touch of a button that can provide huge chunks to the second player

i need to find if the hex values stay the same on restart and if they change when switched over to the pi
  -47E93A8C the golden ticket this is the only one i need to edit 

Control Evniorment - Before i go through the pain of trying to write it on the pi im just going to do it in a vm with the same image 
  -remember that retro pie is actually just an emulator running on raspian which is a flavor of debian
  -found out this will not work because a few things
      -raspberry pi's have amd x86 processors and virtualbox runs x64 
      -this may also mess with memory addresses so lets go to the pi and see what i can do 
      -for this im going to need an eithernet connection
      
      -im going to ssh in
        -here is where it gets painful
          -after adding the mac address to the list of accounts on the wifi i opened an ssh
          -the user is set to pi@theip
          -putty since im on my windows machine at the moment 
          -remember to set up a password it doesnt have one for default 
          -im in 
              -first get apt-get working

              -this i tried and it didnt seem to work i need to identify the actual issue instead of guessing and messing with things
              -https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/9212/dependencies-problem-apt-get-not-working
              -same problem as me 
              -apt-get update

                    -whats this mean 
                        -impiortant error occured durring signature version 
                        -this means that the signature version

              -apt-get dist-upgrade
              
              -this is probably an issue with the ethernet due to the fact that it says it needs signature verification and this 
               network requires a username and password to register the mac address for it to work on the system which i thought i
               did already?
               -many fourms say its a dns problem
               -sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
               -problem it has a weird running version of vi on it but nano works fine so i will use nano
               -comment out #deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
               -apt-get update
               -ok so i reset the address on website and im guessing i just entered the mac address wrong
               
               -try again after comment is removed
               

                
               
              
              -remember a is append in old vi
              
           
              -memory hacking software is scanmem
              -apt-get update for good luck
              -sudo apt-get install scanmem
              -AND IT WORKED
              
              
              -games up and running 
              
      -now i learn to use scanmem
      find the process id of the emulator 
              -ps aux | grep retropie
              -result listing /n64/Super Smash Bros 
              -1373
              -so i set up a game and beat kirby to 31 health 
              -now i search 31*8 so i get the propper value = 248
              -the search takes a minute because there is so many values to search adnthe pi is painfully slow
              -it will also pause the gaem which means that this cant really be used as a cheat but for science i want to change it
              -84407 mateches 
              -hit kirby to 33*=264
              -nothing so i will be taking out the *8 and seing if that works
              -1699488 results
              -hes at 35 now
              -73 matches looks promising 
              -4 matches
              -it contines to be 4 matches and from my research i discovered that there are 4 values holding health so this look slike its it
              -it worked !!!!
              -heres a video of it
