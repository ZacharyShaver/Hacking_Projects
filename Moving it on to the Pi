The goal is to basically write a program at the touch of a button that can provide huge chunks to the second player

i need to find if the hex values stay the same on restart and if they change when switched over to the pi
  -47E93A8C the golden ticket this is the only one i need to edit 

Control Evniorment - Before i go through the pain of trying to write it on the pi im just going to do it in a vm with the same image 
  -remember that retro pie is actually just an emulator running on raspian which is a flavor of debian
  -found out this will not work because a few things
      -raspberry pi's have amd x86 processors and virtualbox runs x64 
      -this may also mess with memory addresses so lets go to the pi and see what i can do 
      -for this im going to need an eithernet connection
      
      -im going to ssh in
        -here is where it gets painful
          -after adding the mac address to the list of accounts on the wifi i opened an ssh
          -the user is set to pi@theip
          -putty since im on my windows machine at the moment 
          -remember to set up a password it doesnt have one for default 
          -im in 
              -first get apt-get working 
              -https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=17016&start=25
              -this is what i did 
              -remember a is append in old vi
              
           
              -memory hacking software is scanmem
              -apt-get update for good luck
              -sudo apt-get install scanmem
