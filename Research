Where to start research 
    First thing i researched was Hacking n64 roms heres what i found that was usefull
      -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxRmQ3bbe1Q
    What i learned 
      -how to detect hex values
    
    
    How do you do it?
       -heres the good stuff
            Setting up the rom on your computer 
              -Project 64 https://www.pj64-emu.com/
              -Memory Hacking http://memoryhacking.com/download.php
              -ROM https://romsmania.com/emulators/nintendo-64/mupen64plus-24
              -Retro pi uses mupen 64 plus
       -once set up 
            ![alt text](https://github.com/ZacharyShaver/Hacking_Projects/blob/master/smash_screenshot.PNG)
            
        -start MHS.exe
        -file open projects 
        -select MHS.exe
        
        Start up a game so you  can find those sweet hexes
            -X is a C is b Enter is start
            -select two player play stock with lots of rounds for testing 
            -select pikachu or your favorite character and your oponets favorite character
            -hyrule works well because its so big
          
          Memory Lookup
            -first im going to look for the hex values of the enemy health
            -to do this youre going to need to have the enemy's hesalth at a searchable value 
            -so zero might not be the best or even something really common like 4
            -i her until she was at 33% which seems like a number that wouldnt show up often 
            -click out of the game before she can do anything more to you ignore that 32% i have 
            -also good to not get a value thats the same as yours
            
            The lookup
            select that small window titled Found Addresses 
                - it will have a little magnifing box on it click the single one 
                
                -Select the value to find as your enemy health
          
                -ok so im guessing you have an over whelming number of hexes that match that, thats okay
                
                -next thing youre going to want to do is to narrow down the search 
                -since these addressses remain saved in your found addresses window you can change one of these values and search one
                    of them if you change a value right?
                -lets see go beat up sammus
                
                -so i got a new value for her health 83 which is a pretty odd number so that will narrow down the search 
                -ignore how she killed me as you can see im not good at smash
                
                -lets preform a second lookup on sammuses health
                -it is the second one with the two magnifing glasses
                
                -one value poped up i got very lucky usually it will not be narrowed down this easy so continue the process
                -right click and add selected from here you can confirm if this address is the one youre looking for 
                -preform again if you wan to be sure but i think this is pretty conclusive so im going to try and modify the value and see
                        what happens 
                 left click in the big square window on the value and go to hex editor 
                    -a bunch of values probaly just showed up for you and you are most likely confused as was i
                    
                    -so remember the value i found was 047A2024 yours may be different im actually about to research this after i conplete this
                    -in this table you can use the rows and columns to find the exact value 
                    -google a decimal to hex table for refrence
                    -from this table i discovered that the value 99 in hex is 63
                    
                ok cool so its right there 
                       -just go to your table and find a hex value with all the numbers and values of the hex for the health value
                            besides the last one which will be a zero
                       -would you look at that a 63
                       -alright im going to try and edit this value and see what happens 
                       -now if you look at your hex table you can chose any value i chose my favorite number 7E which is 126
                        -double click on it and type in your hex and press enter 
                        -close hex editer and lets see
                        -hmm the health doesnt seem to have changed lets see what haoppens if i hit her
                        -nothing happened 
                        
                        -from this i can conclude that i need to preform another search 
                        -what doesnt make sense 
                            -shouldnt there be two values one for the health she actually has and one of the health to display graphically
                     
                        -try again but this time i dont want to die because i am not sure if thaat has an effect on the way things are stored
                        -got her to 81% begin the search 
                        -alright now to 94 to narrow it down
                        -thats weird that same hex keeps showing up
                            -what could this mean 
                                -its probaly associated with the health some how?
                                -im going to start a new game and go about it in a more controlled way
                                
                    How to make it a more controlled setting 
                            -set game up like a standard game 
                            -standard game for me entails two player stock 5 
                            -two player doesnt seem to be detecting any other players
                            -change settings in the emulator?
                                -this can be done in the options of Project 64 
                                -easier to control and replicate conditions
                    Controlled enviorment set up
                        -uppon setting up a controlled enviorment and replicating conditions i noticed two things
                            1.the hex value 047A2024 (one used last time that didnt seem to do anthing) has reappeared
                                -whats this mean 
                                    -hex vales dont change on restart or change of game although the characters are the same 
                                    -a reliable hack can be made from this because the value doesnt have to be relocated every restart
                            2. a new hex showed up 09F3919
                                Lets test and see what editing this one does 
                                    -changed the value to 7F this one doesnt seem to be doing anthing and even after the value was changed
                                        it stayed the same 
                                        
                     Back to 047A2024
                        -What is it?
                            -changing the value doesnt seem to have an effect wile the value does change when changedin game?
                        -try looking for pikachus health 
                            -interesting when you look for it i get that same 047A2024 value which is weird 
                        -what is this value doing?
                            -it shows up with both characters and seems to change based on their health 
                        -what happens if i search for a completly random value and subsearch that random value?
                        
                        Would you look at that it finds the value i just searched for 
                            -what exactly this value is doing i have no idea but i can tell from deducing that this is not the value for the 
                                health 
                         
                        Whot now?
                            -i will reset the hex editing software since multiple times ive closed and opened the emulator 
                            -it uses a process id so its probably a different thing than the emulator
                            -would you doot that tooter it worked i caused it to bug out by restarting 
                            
                Attemot 2:
                    alright time to retry the process and throw out everything i learned before
                        -i found these three values when searching the hexes 
                           -all three change based on the value of player2 health 
                            -3FE64DE8
                                -when i change?
                                    -the health on the screen imedietly changes !!!!!!!!!!!!!
                                    -the 04 hex is also changed which is interesting 
                                    -what about of i hit them will the health stay?
                                        -it doesnt at all actuall it caused the game to crash that interesting 
                                        -reset
                                            -IMPORTANT
                                                -on restart these values stayed and have the same purposes which shows good signs 
                                                    that it can be recreated
                            -3FEF1604
                                -what happens when i change it
                                    -nothing 
                                        -what if i hit them 
                                        -nevermind the game crashed lets try again
                                        -ok so now im getting 5 new values at 47
                                            trying these
                                                -47CD4D5C
                                                doesnt do anything but increases with hits
                                                -47CD4DD4
                                                same
                                                -47CD4DD8
                                                same
                                                -47CD4DE8
                                                when changed it causes the health value to chang ebut goes back once they are hit
                                        -Change all to 0?
                                           -nope
                               - a restart has given me my first sucessful results heres what i did
                                    -these 4 values
                                    
                                    
                                    -i changed each and then preformed an attack
                                    
                                    -for example ill change each to 7F
                                    
                                    and after i attack
                                    
                                    
     Success 
        -i have sucessfully found a recreatable change of health on the enemy character 
            -this has to be done very sneakly and maybe it is not the right thing to edit but the addereess to change to modify the enemies health are
                47CD4D5C
                47CD4DD4
                47CD4DD8
                47E9E354
                    -if all modified at once they cause the enemies health to be put to the selected value after they have been hit
                        -could be used when the enemy is close to death and a small attack could hit like a truck
                        
                        
     What next 
        -next i will be researching values for attacks 
            -what i need 
                -the values for each attack and the values for each attack modifier 
                -to know if attacks are constant or if they are changed based on the enemies health which i think is the case
