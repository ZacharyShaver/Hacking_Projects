Setup

-Once the image is on the disk you can plug in your device 
    Things to plug in
      -SD card
      -HDMI cable
      -power source (im using a power supply that came with  my pi kit, literlly a phone charger with a block will do it)
      -Display, everyone and their grandma has some sort of hdmi monitor. 
      -TV, computer monitor, some tablets, projectors, you can even use your laptop as a dedicated display
      -you can just plug it into yoiur tv and use it as basically an all and one retro system
    
    Overclock
        -n64 roms will not work very well without an overclock 
        -https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Optimization-for-Nintendo-64 (setting i used)
        -these work well with some lag but never at important times 
        -it seems to lag with partocle effects and in the character select screen
        -literly unplayable without an overclock
        -put that fan on full blast and stick your pi right in front of it because she gets toasty
    
    Startup and install
       -plug in the SD card and it sould start and install itself 
       -super easy
